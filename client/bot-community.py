"""
Bootstrap and grow Encointer BOT communities on a *dev* chain or testnet

you may need to install a few packages first
   pip3 install --upgrade pip
   pip3 install randomwords geojson pyproj

then start a node with
   ../target/release/encointer-node-notee --dev --tmp --ws-port 9945 --enable-offchain-indexing true --rpc-methods unsafe

and init and grow a community
   ./bot-community.py --port 9945 init
   ./bot-community.py --port 9945 benchmark

on testnet Gesell, execute the current ceremony phase (it does not advance the phase).
   ./bot-community.py --port 9945 execute-current-phase


NOTE: There are a few extrinsic errors, which are (sometimes) ok to be thrown:
    * Only ok in the first ceremony:
        Module(ModuleError { index: 61, error: 1, message: None }) DispatchInfo { weight: 10000, class: DispatchClass::Normal, pays_fee: Pays::Yes }
        Meaning: Tried to claim rewards when account was not registered. This happens in the first ceremony because no previous meetup took place.

    * Always Ok:
        Module(ModuleError { index: 61, error: 21, message: None }) DispatchInfo { weight: 10000, class: DispatchClass::Normal, pays_fee: Pays::Yes }
        Meaning: Reward was already claimed. This happens because only one participant needs to claim the reward for the whole meetup, afterwards
        above error is thrown.
